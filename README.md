## 👨‍💻 Welcome to Smukx's Cyber Lair 👨‍💻
👋 Greetings, fellow geeks! I'm smukx, a self-proclaimed cyber security ninja 🥷 and AI wizard 🧙‍♂️. If you're into hacking, security, and all things tech, you've come to the right place. 🤓

  ## About Me

👾 I've been hacking since the age of 17, when I first discovered the thrill of breaking into computer systems. Since then, I've developed my skills and become a master of cyber security, with 1 years of experience in the field.

🤖 When I'm not hacking, I'm diving into the world of AI and machine learning. I believe that these technologies hold immense potential for cyber security, and I'm always looking for ways to leverage them to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. 🤖

## Projects

💻 My GitHub repository is where I showcase some of my best work. Here are a few recent projects that I'm particularly proud of:

- PROJECT 1 -> <a href="https://github.com/Whitecat18/Ps-script-for-Hackers-and-Pentesters" > Powershell for Hackers and Pentesters 👨‍💻<a/>
- PROJECT 2 -> <a href="https://github.com/Whitecat18/windows-10-Activator" > Windows 10 Activator ⚙️ <a/>
- PROJECT 3 -> <a href="https://github.com/Whitecat18/Add-Free-Youtube-Server" > Add Free Youtube Server ☘️ </a>

🔓 All of my code is open-source, so feel free to take a peek and use it for your own nefarious purposes. 😈
